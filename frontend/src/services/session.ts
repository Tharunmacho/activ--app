/**
 * ============================================================================
 * WHO IS SIGNED IN, AND WHERE THEY LAND — one answer for the whole app
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Mirrors the website exactly (same backend, same database):
 *
 *   Member sign-in  (LoginScreen)       POST /auth/login { …, portal: 'member' }
 *   Admin sign-in   (AdminLoginScreen)  POST /auth/login { …, portal: 'admin' }
 *
 * The SERVER refuses the wrong screen before any token is issued (a member on
 * the admin screen, an admin on the member screen), with its own sentence.
 *
 * Where each account lands:
 *   member         paid (membershipStatus active/completed, and the renewal is
 *                  not expired) → PaidDashboard, otherwise → MemberMain
 *                  (the unpaid dashboard). Read from GET /members/my-profile,
 *                  the same answer the website's getPaymentStatus() uses.
 *   block_admin    → BlockDashboard
 *   district_admin → DistrictDashboard
 *   state_admin    → StateDashboard
 *   super_admin    → SuperAdminDashboard
 *   events_admin   → EventsAdminHome — event check-in at the door (scan the
 *                  attendees' QR entry passes). The programme itself is
 *                  still written on the website.
 *   anything else  (the CMS account) → not served by the app; the caller
 *                  signs them out and says to use the website.
 *
 * Login, the admin login and the startup restore all route through here, so
 * the three can never disagree about where an account belongs.
