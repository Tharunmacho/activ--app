              * A FULL-SCREEN SLIDESHOW: THE PICTURE FILLS THE BAND EDGE TO EDGE
              * ==================================================================
              *
              * From `md` the picture COVERS the whole band — no box, no blurred
              * side bars (both were tried; the association wants the photograph
              * full screen). The band's HEIGHT follows the screen's shape
              * (16:9, capped at 88vh) instead of a fixed 85vh, so a 16:9 photo or
              * poster fills it with nothing cut, and other shapes lose only a
              * sliver top and bottom.
              *
              * The statistics card sits UNDER the band, overlapping only its
              * edge — pinned across the bottom it covered the lowest fifth of
              * every picture, which on a poster is the venue and the date.
              *
              * ON A PHONE the band is portrait, so the picture is shown whole
              * (`contain`) over a blurred copy of itself; `cover` there cut the
              * people off a landscape photo.
